## INTRODUCTION

Heart disease is a leading cause of death globally, affecting millions of people.
This presentation explores the use of predictive modeling to identify individuals at high risk for heart disease.
Exploring a comprehensive dataset of 500 patients.
We will explore data patterns and uncover insights into risk factors and predictive modeling for heart disease.

### Tools:
Python

## WORK FLOW

* Data Collection and Preprocessing📥

* Data Cleaning🧹

* Outlier detection and file handling🗃️

* Exploratory Data Analysis📊

### Dataset
Columns :

Age,
Gender,
Cholesterol Level,
Blood Pressure,
Smoking Status,
Diabetes,
Family History,
BMI,
Resting Heart Rate,
Alcohol Consumption,
Diet Type,
Stress Level,
Sleep Hours Per Night,
Exercise Hours Per Week,
Physical Activity Level.

* Target Variable :-
Heart Disease: Yes or No

* Number of Rows : 500

* Data types : Integer, Float, Object


## CONCLUSION

* This dataset shows that factors like high cholesterol, obesity, lack of exercise, smoking, and stress are major contributors to heart disease.

* Regular physical activity and managing stress can help reduce risk, while smoking and diabetes increase it.

* Focusing on early detection and lifestyle changes can improve heart health and reduce the impact of heart disease.
