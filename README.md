INTRODUCTION

Heart disease is a leading cause of death globally, affecting millions of people.
This presentation explores the use of predictive modeling to identify individuals at high risk for heart disease.
Exploring a comprehensive dataset of 500 patients.
We will explore data patterns and uncover insights into risk factors and predictive modeling for heart disease.


WORK FLOW

Data Collection and Preprocessing  -  Data Cleaning  -  Outlier detection and file handling  -  Exploratory Data Analysis









CONCLUSION

This dataset shows that factors like high cholesterol, obesity, lack of exercise, smoking, and stress are major contributors to heart disease. Regular physical activity and managing stress can help reduce risk, while smoking and diabetes increase it. Focusing on early detection and lifestyle changes can improve heart health and reduce the impact of heart disease.
